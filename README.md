War is a straightforward comparison-based card game that uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The gameplay involves no decision-making or strategy — the results rely entirely on the order of the shuffled cards.

Each round, both players reveal their top card:

The player with the higher-ranked card wins both cards.

If both cards have the same rank, a “war” occurs — adding excitement and unpredictability to the game.

🧩 Rules of the Game

Deck Setup:

A standard 52-card deck is shuffled and split evenly between two players.

Each player holds their cards in a personal pile (face down).

Gameplay Rounds:

Both players reveal (flip) the top card from their pile at the same time.

The player with the higher-ranked card takes both cards and places them at the bottom of their deck.

If the cards are of equal rank, it triggers a “WAR.”

War Condition:

Each player places three cards face down and then one card face up.

The player whose face-up card has the higher rank wins all the cards from that battle.

If the new face-up cards tie again, another “war” begins, repeating the process until a winner is determined.

Winning the Game:

The game continues until one player collects all 52 cards.

If one player runs out of cards during a war, the other player automatically wins.
